# Data_Modeling
Relational DBMS with PostgreSQL For Sparkify (Music Liberary Startup)

## Use Case of This Project

Why are we creating this database?
Why we choose star schema and how did we decide on this specific 3 tables schema?
*explain first the raw files (song files and log files), what is in them? and what do we need from them?*

## How to Create This Database

1) unzip data.tar file to get the data
2) run create_tables.py first then run etl.py
*install pandas package using pip install pandas*
3) run test.ipynb on jupyter notebook to test that the database has been created successfully
*check sql_queries.py for the quesries used to create the database in case a change is needed*
*check etl.ipynb in order to view the process of testing the creation of the etl.py code*
